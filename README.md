THIRD YEAR PROJECT 
# Application Description 
SkinSensor is an android application designed to aid dermatologists/doctors and patients to physically mon- itor the development of a skin disorder/condition on a human body. This application would help the user to monitor the pre-existing condition.

Project Aims
===========

The aim of this project is to produce a unique and improved application with the feature of taking a picture or collection of pictures of the user’s skin through an intuitive and highly graphical interface, so that the user would be able to monitor their own skin-conditions, disorders, allergies and so on. One of the key aspects of the project is the use of camera for different purposes, which would enhance the functionality of this application.
The main objective is to give patients the capability to monitor their own conditions in a consistent way using images that have been self-captured using their smartphones. An additional magnifier can be attached in case the user desires to increase they’re zooming capabilities of the camera otherwise normal zooming is pre-given. When a preview of the image is collected by the user, they would have the capability to calibrate and edit the picture to re-define its definitions and the layers affecting the area of that specific picture to fully maximise the focus of the disorder.
The device must work coherently to monitor the user’s existing skin-condition, as well as to be able to investigate new appearances of skin features. By doing so, the collected metadata can be added by the user to register their history and to progressively view the results and act accordingly.
Finally, the application itself must have an optimal graphical user interface, one that captures the user’s attention and is easy to use and manage. A main aspect that would capture the user’s attention would be the use of a human body image, where the user would be able to zoom in and select a specific part of the human body depending on their preference. By applying this user interface, SkinSensor aims to bring a new styling and innovation to use a simple skin-condition monitoring app.

Human Model
===========
SkinSensor gives the ability to the user to understand the human body. Multiple ideas were written and reported while sketching the design for SkinSensor, as the objectives of such have changed overall, various implementations were also discarded because of time limit. The main idea that symbolised SkinSensor from previous applications is the attachment of the anatomical picture of the human body, as this was early in- troduced to be made as a 3D model, however due to inconsistency of libraries and struggle to create of such the idea changed to a 2D model. The idea behind this is to give out a unique and new feature to the user
11
to interact, as this has never been introduced in any other application the anatomical image of the human model will boost the attention of the user.
Hence, a human model image is brought up on the home page. The sketches were done accordingly, and is coloured according to each body part, which means that whenever the user wants to take an image of a spe- cific body part, they can just zoom in and click on the body part, which navigates them to the corresponding body part activity, where the images would later on be taken. In order to incorporate this in my project, I initially sketched the human models in 3 different directions (front, back and side). This was then labelled, which can be seen in the figure below. Then, it was coloured accordingly, to create a better visualisation for the user.

Image Reference 
===========
The ’image reference’, which is the rightmost icon of this page. If you would like to take an image like before, it is impossible for you to remember and get the exact angle. The objective of image reference is when you take a picture of the same body part, it lets you position the camera exactly like before or at least closely to before by providing a slightly transparent overlay, so you can compare two images. The process is as follows: the user clicks and selects an image that they would like to use as an ’image reference’, then they are navigated to camera, where they would be able to see the image reference transparent, as well as the background picture that they would like to take. Here, they can control the transparency using the bar, so they can see the image reference clearer/more transparent.
