# Application Description 
SkinSensor is an android application designed to aid dermatologists/doctors and patients to physically mon- itor the development of a skin disorder/condition on a human body. This application would help the user to monitor the pre-existing condition.

Project Aims
===========

The aim of this project is to produce a unique and improved application with the feature of taking a picture or collection of pictures of the user’s skin through an intuitive and highly graphical interface, so that the user would be able to monitor their own skin-conditions, disorders, allergies and so on. One of the key aspects of the project is the use of camera for different purposes, which would enhance the functionality of this application.
The main objective is to give patients the capability to monitor their own conditions in a consistent way using images that have been self-captured using their smartphones. An additional magnifier can be attached in case the user desires to increase they’re zooming capabilities of the camera otherwise normal zooming is pre-given. When a preview of the image is collected by the user, they would have the capability to calibrate and edit the picture to re-define its definitions and the layers affecting the area of that specific picture to fully maximise the focus of the disorder.
The device must work coherently to monitor the user’s existing skin-condition, as well as to be able to investigate new appearances of skin features. By doing so, the collected metadata can be added by the user to register their history and to progressively view the results and act accordingly.
Finally, the application itself must have an optimal graphical user interface, one that captures the user’s attention and is easy to use and manage. A main aspect that would capture the user’s attention would be the use of a human body image, where the user would be able to zoom in and select a specific part of the human body depending on their preference. By applying this user interface, SkinSensor aims to bring a new styling and innovation to use a simple skin-condition monitoring app.
